🎨pgwatch UI Improvements 

This documentation details the complete transformation of a basic login form into a modern,interactive, and secure authentication interface using Material-UI (MUI), TSS-React and Yup validation. The enhancements include:


✅ Visual & Interaction Upgrades (Animations, Gradients, Hover Effects)


✅ Functional Improvements (Form Validation, Password Toggle, Success Feedback)


✅ Codebase Refactoring (Modular Styles, Type Safety, Separation of Concerns)


✅ Performance & UX Optimizations (Smooth Transitions, Snackbar Notifications)


🔐 Login Form Updations
1. Login Form Modernization
   
Before (Basic Implementation)


tsx
Copy
<Button variant="contained">Login</Button>
<TextField label="Username" />
<TextField label="Password" type="password" />
After (Enhanced Implementation)
tsx

{/* Gradient Button with Hover Animation */}  
<Button  
  sx={{  
    background: "linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)",  
    color: "white",  
    fontWeight: "bold",  
    transition: "all 0.3s ease",  
    "&:hover": {  
      transform: "translateY(-2px)",  
      boxShadow: "0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)",  
    },  
  }}  
>  
  Sign In ✨  
</Button>  

{/* Interactive Input Fields */}  
<OutlinedInput  
  sx={{  
    "&:hover": {  
      borderColor: "#667eea",  
      transform: "translateY(-1px)",  
    },  
    "&.Mui-focused": {  
      borderColor: "#764ba2",  
    },  
  }}  
/>  
Key Improvements:

•	Card-Like Components: Each child element now has a white background, rounded corners, and shadow effects.


•	Hover Effects: Components lift slightly and increase shadow on hover for better interactivity.


•	Consistent Spacing: Uniform padding and gap between elements for a clean layout.
