## üìå Learning Process & Team Effort  
Before working on these enhancements, our team went through an **intensive learning phase** to understand the architecture and functionality of **pgwatch2**. This was a **challenging yet rewarding journey**, especially since none of us had prior experience with **Docker** or the internals of **pgwatch2**.  

We collectively:  
- **Explored pgwatch2‚Äôs architecture** through its documentation and source code.  
- **Set up Docker for the first time**, learning containerized deployments and service orchestration.  
- **Configured and analyzed the pgwatch monitoring databases**, experimenting with real-time stats and stored metrics.  

While this process was **long and tiresome, each of us contributed equally** to understanding the system. The excitement of taking **baby steps‚Äîlike successfully connecting and monitoring databases‚Äîwas a huge motivator.  

üìÑ A **detailed documentation** of our **learning process** is available in the **[`arjun` branch]([https://github.com/ml-agg08/pgwatch2--enhancements/blob/arjun/README.md](https://github.com/ml-agg08/pgwatch2--enhancements/blob/arjun/ENVIRONMENTAL%20SETUP%20AND%20LEARNING%20PROCESS.pdf))**. While the documentation is maintained there, it represents the **collective effort** of all three team members.
