### **üìå Learning Process & Team Effort**  
Before working on these enhancements, our team went through an **intensive learning phase** to understand the architecture and functionality of **pgwatch2**. This was a **challenging yet rewarding journey**, especially since none of us had prior experience with **Docker** or the internals of **pgwatch2**.  

We collectively:  
- **Explored pgwatch2‚Äôs architecture** through its documentation and source code.  
- **Set up Docker for the first time**, learning containerized deployments and service orchestration.  
- **Configured and analyzed the pgwatch monitoring databases**, experimenting with real-time stats and stored metrics.  

While this process was **long and tiresome, each of us contributed equally** to understanding the system. The excitement of taking **baby steps‚Äîlike successfully connecting and monitoring databases‚Äîwas a huge motivator.**  

A **detailed documentation** of our **learning process** is available in the **Arjun‚Äôs branch**. While the documentation is maintained there, it represents the collective effort of all three team members.
